""""
CORS or "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" refers to the situations when a frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code
that communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different "origin" than the frontend.
OriginÂ¶
An origin is the combination of protocol (http, https), domain (myapp.com, localhost, localhost.tiangolo.com), and port (80, 443, 8080).

So, all these are different origins:

http://localhost
https://localhost
http://localhost:8080
Even if they are all in localhost, they use different protocols or ports, so, they are different "origins".
